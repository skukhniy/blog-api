# RESTful API Blog

### [Live Demo](http://18.234.147.248/)

## Description
A MERN-stack blog app using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Bootstrap, PassportJS, and a REST API. Deployed with AWS EC2. Actively updated with blog posts about projects I am working on.

## Getting started

After cloning the repo, run:

```elm
cd server
npm install
npm run devStart
```

The REST API is now running at `localhost:4000`.

```
cd client
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

The client is now running at `localhost:3000`.
